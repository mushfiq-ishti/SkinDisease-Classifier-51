# SkinDisease-Classifier-51
This project focuses on DL approches for image classification of 51 skin diseases using TensorFlow and PyTorch. It leverages 8 pretrained models — ResNet50, EfficientNet, ConvNeXt, VGG16, MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, Vision Transformer, and Swin Transformer — and explores fine-tuning with InceptionV3.

The repository includes:

Reusable Jupyter Notebook for training, evaluation, and analysis

Performance evaluation using multiple metrics

Grad-CAM visualizations for model interpretability

The dataset is privately merged, and the shared notebooks are designed for future reuse and experimentation with different models and approaches.
